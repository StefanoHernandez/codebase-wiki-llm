In these instructions, `<wiki-root>` is this repository's wiki directory,
relative to the repository root (`wiki` by default). Resolve it once, before
anything else, use the resolved value in every wiki path, and state it:
`Wiki root: <value>/`.

1. If your context contains a line `Codebase Wiki LLM: wiki_root: <value>`
   (added when the session started) and you have not created or changed the
   wiki root during this session, use `<value>`.
2. Otherwise, if `.wikidir` exists at the repository root, read that file
   directly: its first non-empty line is the folder name. Do not look for it
   with a file search: searches skip hidden and gitignored files.
3. Otherwise, if `wiki/SCHEMA.md` exists, `<wiki-root>` is `wiki`.
4. Otherwise the repository has no wiki yet.

The value must be a single directory name matching
`^\.?[A-Za-z0-9]([A-Za-z0-9._-]*[A-Za-z0-9_-])?$` (no trailing dot) and must
not be one of `.git`, `.github`, `.claude`, `.codex`, `.agents`, `.agent`,
`.gemini`, `.opencode`, `.obsidian`, `.vscode`, `node_modules`, `.wikidir`,
compared case-insensitively. If it breaks these rules or names a directory
that does not exist, stop and tell the user without guessing another location.
